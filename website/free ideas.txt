beans

this is the road

maybe i might get out of here someday

bread

tape

i'm on the floor

hang me

i'm writing a letter to you on my floor

sometimes i stand in my room

sometimes i whatever

this is a song, and i'm singing it.

nothing is real

i want to make everyone feel happy

try to write a bad, bad song 'til i ruin someone's day

guess i'm never gonna fall in love

could this be love??

the world is a pineapple.

i love you
